## My process

### Built with

- Typescript
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - JS web framework
- [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - For the routing and server-side rendering
- [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) - For hosting the app

### What I learned

Working with Svelte, I've gained a deeper understanding of reactive programming and its benefits in creating dynamic web applications. Through creating components in Svelte, I've learned the power of its reactive declarations and how efficiently it updates the DOM. Moreover, I've discovered the elegance of Svelte's syntax and its ability to streamline the development process compared to traditional frameworks. Additionally, I've honed my skills in managing component state and event handling, fostering a more organized and maintainable codebase. Overall, working with Svelte has broadened my perspective on frontend development and equipped me with valuable tools for building responsive and performant web applications.

### Continued development

In future projects, I aim to delve deeper into advanced state management techniques in Svelte, such as utilizing stores effectively for more complex applications. Additionally, I want to explore Svelte's integration with server-side rendering (SSR) and progressive web app (PWA) features to enhance performance and user experience further. Furthermore, refining my understanding of Svelte's transition and animation capabilities will be a focus, as incorporating these elements can greatly enhance the visual appeal of applications. Lastly, I intend to continue improving my proficiency in testing Svelte components to ensure robustness and reliability in my codebases.

### Useful resources

- [Learn Svelte](https://learn.svelte.dev) - This is an amazing resource that helped me understand the core concepts of Svelte.
- [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) - The official documentation for Svelte Kit is a great resource for learning how to build apps with Svelte Kit.
